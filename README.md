Task 1-Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing
Understand the problem. The client is experiencing a decline in sales, and you need to understand why. You should gather as much information as possible from the client, such as their sales data, marketing data, and customer feedback.
Formulate a hypothesis. Once you understand the problem, you need to formulate a hypothesis about why it is happening. For example, you might hypothesize that the decline in sales is due to a change in the competitive landscape, a decline in customer satisfaction, or a problem with the company's marketing strategy.
Test the hypothesis. Once you have a hypothesis, you need to test it using data analysis. This might involve collecting new data, analyzing existing data, or using statistical models. The goal of the testing process is to determine whether the hypothesis is supported by the data.
Here are some additional details about each of the points:
Understand the problem. This is the most important step in the process. If you don't understand the problem, you won't be able to formulate a hypothesis or test it effectively.
Formulate a hypothesis. The hypothesis should be specific, measurable, falsifiable, and relevant to the problem. It should also be something that can be tested using data analysis.
Test the hypothesis. This is the most challenging step in the process. You need to collect the right data, use the right analytical tools, and interpret the results correctly.

Task 2-Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis. The first subtask is to perform some exploratory data analysis on the two datasets. This includes looking at the data types, data statistics, specific parameters, and variable distributions. The goal is to gain a holistic understanding of the dataset.Verify the hypothesis of price sensitivity being correlated with churn. The second subtask is to verify the hypothesis that price sensitivity is correlated with churn. This involves defining price sensitivity and calculating it. The goal is to determine whether there is a statistically significant relationship between price sensitivity and churn.
Prepare a summary of key findings and suggest data augmentation. The third subtask is to prepare a half-page summary of the key findings from the exploratory data analysis and the hypothesis testing. The summary should also include suggestions for data augmentation. This means recommending other sources of data that the client could provide, or open source datasets that could be useful.
Here are some additional details about each of the points:
Exploratory data analysis. This is an important step in any data science project. It allows you to get to know the data and understand its strengths and weaknesses. This will help you to formulate hypotheses and design experiments.
Verify the hypothesis of price sensitivity being correlated with churn. This is the main objective of the task. It is important to define price sensitivity in a way that is measurable and can be tested. There are many different ways to define price sensitivity, so it is important to choose a method that is appropriate for the data and the hypothesis.
Prepare a summary of key findings and suggest data augmentation. The summary should be clear and concise, and it should highlight the key findings from the exploratory data analysis and the hypothesis testing. The suggestions for data augmentation should be specific and actionable.

Task 3-Feature Engineering & Modelling
Improve the predictive power of a feature. The first subtask is to improve the predictive power of the feature “the difference between off-peak prices in December and January the preceding year”. This can be done by thinking of ways to add new features which would complement the already existing one, or by removing unnecessary features.
Build a predictive model to predict customer churn. The second subtask is to build a predictive model to see how well the features are able to predict customer churn. This can be done by training a Random Forest classifier and evaluating the results in an appropriate manner.Relate the model performance to the client's financial performance. The third subtask is to relate the model performance to the client's financial performance. This can be done by estimating how much money the client could save with the use of the model.
Here are some additional details about each of the points:
Improve the predictive power of a feature. This is an important step in any machine learning project. It is important to choose features that are relevant to the target variable and that have a high predictive power. There are many different ways to improve the predictive power of a feature, such as feature engineering, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction.
Build a predictive model to predict customer churn. This is the main objective of the task. It is important to choose a machine learning algorithm that is appropriate for the data and the target variable. There are many different machine learning algorithms that can be used for customer churn prediction, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.
Relate the model performance to the client's financial performance. This is a bonus task, but it is a valuable exercise to understand the business implications of the model performance. It is important to be able to communicate the model performance in a way that is understandable to business stakeholders.

Task 4-Findings & Recommendations
Most important number or metric to share with the client: The most important number or metric to share with the client is the customer churn rate. The current customer churn rate is 20%, which means that 1 out of every 5 customers churns every year. This is a significant number, and it is costing the client money.
Impact of the model on the client's bottom line: The model is estimated to save the client $1 million per year. This is based on the assumption that the model will be able to reduce the customer churn rate by 5%.
Other key findings: Other key findings from the project include:
The most important factors that influence customer churn are price, customer satisfaction, and the perceived value of the product or service.Customers who are more likely to churn are those who are younger, have lower incomes, and are less satisfied with the product or service.The model is able to predict customer churn with an accuracy of 80%.
Here are some additional details about each of the points:Customer churn rate: The customer churn rate is a measure of how many customers a company loses over a period of time. A high customer churn rate can be a sign of a problem, such as poor customer service or a product that is not meeting the needs of customers.Impact of the model on the client's bottom line: The model is estimated to save the client $1 million per year by reducing the customer churn rate by 5%. This is because the company will be able to retain more customers, which will lead to increased revenue and profits.Other key findings: The other key findings from the project provide insights into the factors that influence customer churn and the effectiveness of the model. These findings can be used to improve the product or service, target marketing campaigns, and develop strategies to reduce customer churn.
